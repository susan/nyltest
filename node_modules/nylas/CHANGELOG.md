* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Changed models for `Contact`, `Draft`, `Event`, `File`, `Folder`, `Message`, and `Thread` to accurately reflect the attribute that the API returns

* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Return `Message` object instead of `Draft` object after send
* Return sending failures for partial sends
* Return server errors for SMTP exceptions on send
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Privatized `_range()`, `_getModel()`, and `_getModelCollection()` (not documented)

* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Removed support for `generateCursor()`, which has been deprecated
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Removed support for the `trial` option for auth, which has been deprecated

###  3.1.1 / 2017-10-06

* No longer throw an error after successful calls to `Message.sendRaw()`

* Fix missing fields and typos in message and thread models

### 3.0.0 / 2016-08-14

* Add support for `view=expanded` option. Now all methods on that hit the API can take querystring params as objects. Additionally, you can pass in `{expanded: true}` for convenience.
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: `DeltaStream` now also supports `view=expanded`, `exclude_types`, and `include_types`, as well as any arbitrary query string param. `Delta::startStream` now takes an object as a second argument for query string params, instead of an `exclude_types` array.
